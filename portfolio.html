<p>Timothy J. Rose, or TJ, a junior at Bitney College Prep High School, has launched a project to raise money and supplies to support Syrian refugees, with the high hopes of reaching $50,000.

<br>Rose chose to support the Syrian refugees because he feels that most of the time, more local issues have more venues for community support, and options for fundraising. And, he said, refugees in Syria are targeted simply for where they live, even when they take no side in the conflict, with “no choice to get back on their feet.” Many displaced refugees are gathered in large camps in bordering countries because they have nowhere else left to go. According to the Associated Press, there are an estimated 75,000 still stuck between a war zone and a sealed border. There they struggle still, with lack of food, clothing and funding.
<br>
<br>Rose’s project started in early September, and has so far received $550 — and around 70 pounds of clothing. But that number continues to grow as word gets out on his efforts.
<br>
<br>Rose says he also chose this project because he believes “a little money goes a long way there.”
<br>
<br>“Five dollars here is a cup of coffee, but for a child in Syria, it’s a pair of shoes,” he said. “It’s just amazing how far that goes.”
<br>
<br>“The fight in Syria could not be more real or more serious,” he continued. “It is … a large scale massacre that is out of control.”
<br>
<br>The United Nations and Arab League Envoy to Syria estimated there have been 400,000 Syrians killed in the Civil War between March 2011 and April 2016, with another 4.8 million Syrians having fled the country and 6.6 million people being displaced internally.
<br>
<br>Rose had been accepting donations and keeping them in a lockbox on campus, but now is keeping the proceeds with the Bitney Parent Council. For those who want to donate, checks and cash along with clothes and canned foods, can also be left in the office at Bitney College Prep with Angelina Young, the school’s secretary.
<br>
<br>All checks should be made out to the Bitney Parent Council, noting the donation is for the Syrian Refugee Fund.
<br>
<br>Rose is also in the process of planning a bake sale and informational fundraiser, with the date and location information soon to be posted on the project’s website. Those who wish to send supplies via mail, should email thesyrianwarrefugeeproject@gmail.com for a mailing address.
<br>
<br>On Rose’s project website (See this story at TheUnion.com for a direct link), you can find updates on his project’s progress and more information on him and his project.
<br>

<br><p>Grass Valley writer Janet Ann Collins is the author of “Secret Service Saint,” a children’s Christian fiction story that tells the tale of the good deeds of Santa Claus.
<br>
<br>		<p>The book portrays the story of Saint Nicholas — the man we now call Santa Claus.
<br>
<br><p>The book, aimed at children aged 3 to 8. dates back to Collins’ use of American Sign Language to tell the story of Saint Nicholas to three deaf foster children.
<br>
<br>Later, she wrote out the story, and it was published in a children’s magazine — her first professionally published work.
<br>
<br>A different version was taken up by a children’s book publisher, and released as “Secret Service Saint.”
<br>
<br>The most recent book from Collins is “A Shadow of Fear.” She has published a total of four children’s books, along with dozens of newspaper articles.
<br>
<br>“I can’t stop writing, and I hope to have a lot more things published in the future.” Collins said.
<br>
<br>She said she reads many books each week — including young adult books and other publications for children and youth.
<br>
<br>Her advice for new authors is to do extensive research and “read a lot,” she said.
<br>
<br>“Do the best work you can, and take the risk of submitting it to publishers,” she said. “Of course, all writers sometimes get rejections, but that’s part of the learning process. It also helps a lot to join writers’ groups, especially with members who write things in the same genre as you do, and to attend conferences.” (Collins is participating in the upcoming Sierra Writers conference Jan. 20-21 at Sierra College in Grass Valley. See http://www.sierrawritersconference.com/)
<br>
<br>Collins’ books are available through Amazon, Barnes & Noble and her website, http://www.janetcollins.com. Local bookstores can also special order the books.

    <p>	<br>Tony Martin always tries his best.
<br>
    	<br>In his 90 years, Martin said he has always been determined and dedicated to giving his all — and more.
<br>
    <br>As a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service, or as a ballplayer in the Gold Country Senior Softball Association, Martin said he always gives it “200 percent.”
<br>
  <br>  Martin has been playing in the GCSSA for nearly 30 years, starting in 1987. He played third base when he was into his 80s, determined to do his best — regardless of position. He’s so determined in fact, he plans on playing, “as long as the good Lord lets me.”
<br>
   <br> Considering his health and determination, that could very well be quite awhile.
<br>
   <br> Naturally he has slowed down over the years, but as he embarks on his ninth decade he’s still taking the field, and producing. Last season, Martin notched a .287 batting average and drove in 15 runs. This season, Martin plays for B&C True Value and notched an RBI and a run scored in their first game.
<br>“It’s under my skin, that I can’t play like I used to, but I still give it everything I have,” said Martin.
<br>
  <br> 	He added what he enjoys most about softball is trying to get the out, regardless of how difficult the play. 
<br>
		<h2><br><bold>A bit about Tony</bold></h2>
<br>
	<br>Martin, a Massachusetts native, served four years in the United States Navy. He served during World War II, where his ship earned four battle stars in the Pacific.</p>
<br>
	<br>Martin moved to the Bay Area after his four-year stint in the Navy. He said he chose the Bay Area to get away from the cold weather.</p>
<br>
	<br>With a desire to live in the country, Martin moved to Nevada County with his wife in 1981 when he retired. After seeing an ad in the paper for a home in Nevada County, he said he packed up and moved to Grass Valley.
<br>
<br>Martin appreciates the outdoors, always has. He enjoys the challenges provided by the outdoors and by sports, and likes to exert himself. In his younger years he enjoyed the snow and skiing in the Sierra.
<br>
<br>He has been exercising his whole life, be it playing sports, or working as a letter carrier for the Postal Service. He said all the physical fitness is great for his health and recommends to seniors they should get out and try some exercise for themselves.
<br>
	<br>As for Martin’s advice for younger people — always give your all in every endeavor. It will always help later in life. And, as he has said since the start, you should always be determined to do your best.

    <h2><a href="http://www.theunion.com/news/local-news/police-urge-caution-to-nevada-county-residents-targeted-for-phone-scams/"#><span>Scam Calls</a></span></h2>

		<p><br>Scam phone calls are a scary prospect for Mary Vasquez, a local senior who says she is a frequent target.
<br>
<br>These phone calls can come in very frequently, sometimes many times a day, according to Vasquez, and can be both annoying and frightening. Vasquez does not pick up the phone unless she recognizes the number. Instead, she listens for a message to confirm the identity of her caller.
<br>
<br>			“It’s impossible for someone to retire peaceably with calls like these,” said Vasquez.
<br>
<br>According to the U.S. Census, nearly 25 percent of Nevada County residents are age 65 or older, meaning area communities are likely targeted for scams by those seeking to take advantage of senior citizens. A study showed in 2015, approximately 27 million Americans (11 percent of the adult population) were victimized by phone scams, compared to only 7 percent in a similar 2014 survey. Total 2015 losses to phone scams was reported to be $7.4 billion, or an average loss of nearly $274 per victim.
<br>
<br>The calls tend to come from unofficial area codes or be “spoofed,” a common tactic used by scammers, according to the fraud awareness section of AT&T’s website. These calls mostly target seniors and often impersonate official departments like the U.S. Treasury, the IRS or public utility companies.
<br>
<br>Vasquez said she has never called the numbers left on the messages due to the negative ratings online and assurance from her tax preparer that the calls are scams and her finances are all in order.
<br>Vasquez also noted in a letter she submitted to The Union that the caller’s voice was deep and “sounding like a police officer,” adding to the fear factor. The calls can create a great deal of anxiety for her and others.
<br>
<br>	“If I had a heart condition, I could have a heart attack,” says Vasquez.
<br>
<br>Sergeant Dan Kimbrough, an officer in the Grass Valley Police Department, said reports of scams are received “more than you may think,” but he could not provide an exact number. Typically, though, such reports are filed usually two or three times a week, although the frequency has been seemingly on the rise the past few years.
<br>
<br>“We try to educate as much as possible” on scams and identity theft, said Kimbrough.
<br>
<br>When a frequent scam seems to be spreading throughout the community, Grass Valley Police might also report it on the department’s Facebook page or set up meetings with community watch programs to help spread awareness.
<br>
<br>Kimbrough cautioned against giving any information over the phone — especially if you aren’t the one who initiated the call — and to do research before giving anything away. He also encourages residents to call and speak with an officer if they have any concerns about phone calls asking for important information. The Grass Valley Police Department’s non-emergency number is 530-477-4600. Scams are not only limited to home phones, but can also target cell phones, text messaging and email.
<br>
<br>There are also rules from the FCC about telemarketing and spam for continuous calls that may not be scams but are frequent or bothersome. Rules on automated calling and spam can be found on the FCC website at https://www.fcc.gov/stop-unwanted-calls and information on fraud and scams at https://www.fcc.gov/general/frauds-scams-and-alerts-guides.
<br>
<br>To date in 2016, PG&E has received more than 2,400 scam reports, according to the Associated Press. Scammers continue to employ increasingly more sophisticated tactics to exploit customers. PG&E continues to work with law enforcement agencies that are conducting investigations as well as supporting ongoing efforts to help educate customers about scams.
<br>
<br>PG&E is joining utilities throughout North America to make customers aware of telephone, mail, email and door-to-door/in-person scams that involve criminals posing as utility company representatives and demanding immediate payment or personal information. The “Utilities United Against Scams” collaboration has designated Nov. 16 as “Utilities United Against Scams Day.” The day will be supported by a weeklong campaign with information focused on exposing the tricks scammers use to steal from customers, and how customers can protect themselves. Customers who suspect or experience fraud, or feel threatened during contact with one of these utility scammers, should contact local authorities and then PG&E at 1-800-743-5000.</p>

      <br>  <p>     Love in Nevada County (LiNC) is a group of more than 20 Christian churches, all determined to help their community.
<br>
   <br> This weekend they’ll be working together on a day of community service with more than 40 projects.
<br>
 <br>   Registration is still available on the LiNC Facebook page. There are nearly 300 people already signed up to dedicate some of their time to the community in coalition with LiNC on Saturday. For information, call Kari Stehmeyer at 530-401-6136.
<br>
 <br>   LiNC was formed last December by Janet Lowell and Dan Prout, as they originally sought to help unify local clergy to relocate folks after a large fire. Afterward, Lowell contacted the local churches and invited them to unify and plan ways to serve the community — with the goal of keeping churches connected all the time, not just in times of crisis.
<br>
<br>    Registration is still available on the LiNC Facebook page (See this story at TheUnion.com for a direct link)
<br>
<br>    More than 20 local churches send two representatives to meetings held about once a month.
<br>
<br>    For those who do not use computers, LiNC welcomes anyone to join them and help the community. There is a large variety of projects allowing for anyone to find something they can do to help out. Projects vary in time, allowing participants to choose a time of day to help out when they are free.
<br>
<br>    Projects are geared toward helping local nonprofits and public facilities, such as local schools like Pleasant Valley and Ready Springs schools, and thrift stores, along with clean-up at camps such as at Camp Diamond Arrow. Other projects include landscaping, gardening, irrigation assorted repairs, and even some library work.
<br>
<br>    One project with the Sierra Presbyterian includes assisting in store operations at the local Habitat for Humanity “Re-Store,” including cleaning incoming items and helping with sales.
<br>
 <br>   There will be home and yard assistance work to do for local seniors. Referred by Nevada County, the number of elderly people helped will be decided based on number of participants.
<br>
 <br>   One of the projects, a workshop on “How to Minister to Veterans,” will be held at Welcome Home Vets, and hosted by Emmanuel Episcopal.
<br>
 <br>   Local seniors, children and all ages in between have already signed up to lend a helping hand through LiNC.
<br>
 <br>   The projects require no church affiliation. You do not have to be a member of the church hosting the project to join in and help. And you aren’t required to help your own church specifically</p>

<p><br>Bob Jenkins has released the first in a series of novels based in an apocalyptic setting right here in Northern California.
<br>
<br>His book, Azriel Dancer, is the first book in its series, The Daughters of the Kali Yuga, which gives a look into the future after an apocalypse.
<br>
<br>The series will follow along a generation every book, the main character Azriel of “Azriel Dancer” is the mother of Janabai the female protagonist of the second book. Azriel ends up being the grandmother of the final books main character.
<br>
<br>A portion of the book takes place in our own area. The journey starts off near the Yuba River, before heading north and crossing through Downieville, Graeagle, Greenville and eventually ending up in the Klamath Lake area of Southern Oregon.
<br>
<br>The story of this book, and series, follows a group of Nevada County farmers as they learn to survive and thrive in their new world.
<br>
<br>It does contain an “unfathomable evil,” says Jenkins, that one must read the book to discover. It also contains an antagonist who has been described as “a worthy adversary, a mashup of Hannibal Lecter, Loki, and Robin Williams” says Jenkins.
<br>
<br>The series has taken heavy influence from several works. Notably Jenkins says he was inspired by Alan Weisman’s The World Without Us, which he says made him think what it would be like if there were a few humans still alive.
<br>
<br>Some other inspirations listed were Stephen King, Mark Forsyth and Anne Lamont.
<br>
<br>The book is aimed at adults. A few weeks ago however, Jenkins released a short novel called Three Paws, which is aimed at children ages 6-12. Both Three Paws and Azriel Dancer are available on Amazon.com. Jenkins advises new writers to “put your butt in the chair and keep it there,” also suggesting aspiring writers read great writers and make “lots of crappy first drafts.”</p>

<p><br>Bitney College Prep High School is in the planning stage of new feature for its students — a skateboard half pipe, designed by a group of students and local pro skater Stephen Brockway, a father of students working on the project.
<br>
<br>But construction can’t begin without the support of local businesses, in the form of donated materials.
<br>
<br>The project is being designed and built by the students, with funding through donations from the skateboarding community. The structure will be quite large to allow for continuous fun and practice. It will come out to be around 20 feet long.
<br>
<br>Unless the school can find a viable liability plan, the halfpipe would be open to Bitney students only, although there is the chance of summer skateboard classes being implemented.
<br>
<br>The students participating vary in grade level, with freshman Tosh Roberts Brockway, sophomore Mikey Levitan and juniors Ezra Roberts Brockway and Lukas Williams.
<br>
<br>This project has been planned and carried out since the first meeting in early March.
<br>
<br>Scott Young, a Bitney College Prep staff member, has had the idea for two years, but sought students willing to oversee the project themselves. By directing and setting meetings, Young tries to encourage the students to take it upon themselves.
<br>
<br>Tosh Roberts Brockway has been skating for a while. His father skates as does his brother. He hopes the project will succeed in bringing more options to the school, saying the half pipe will be a “good incentive for coming to school” and shows Bitney’s “drive to assist its students in personal endeavors.” He says he is happy to see what was an “unrealistic fantasy,” become an “achievable goal” for the school.
<br>
<br>He said the halfpipe construction would help students learn project management skills and also offer the possibility for classes, fun for skaters at the school and a learning opportunity for students newer to the sport.
<br>
<br>For more information, contact Scott Young at SYoung@BitneyPrep.net or 530-477-1235.

<p><br>Bob Slyker is really into birds.
<br>
<br>One of three leaders of bird walks offered by California State Parks and the South Yuba River Park Association, and an avid fisherman, Slyker has long been interested in wildlife. But about 25 years ago, a friend took him along on a few walks and a fascination with birds began.
<br>
<br>Slyker and his fellow walk leaders will guide seven more walks in 2016, beginning with one slated for at 8 a.m. Saturday at the South Yuba River State Park’s north parking lot.
<br>
<br>“We may see Red-shouldered Hawk, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Nuttall’s Woodpecker, Black Phoebe, Band-tailed Pigeon, and many more,” said Slyker.
<br>
<br>Slyker has been directing bird walks with the South Yuba River Park Association for around a year and a half. He was a docent for the State Parks, and when the previous guide retired, Slyker along with fellow guides Bruce and Carol Malnor were asked by the ranger if they would like to replace him on the walks.
<br>
<br>Slyker is also a member and partakes in activities with another wildlife group, the Sierra Foothills Audubon Society, which has a mission of educating “ourselves and others to the variety and beauty of our natural environment and protect our wildlife and natural places.”
<br>
<br>The walks offer more than just the main focus on birds, those participating will also enjoy the scenery of the river, local geology, plant life, and other wildlife. And the South Yuba also offers many other wilderness activities to sate a variety of interests in nature.
<br>
<br>The walks take place on trails along the river. They typically extend anywhere from an hour and a half, up to even three hours, in duration, varying on weather, time of year, and participant interest.
<br>
<br>Walk organizers ask those attending to wear weather-appropriate clothing and encourage the use of binoculars. And ask those interested to call if weather is questionable.
<br>
<br>Each walks start at 8 a.m. and meet at the South Yuba River State Park’s north parking lot on the following dates: Saturday, May 14, June 10, July 9, Sept. 10, Oct. 8, and Dec. 10.
<br>

<p><br>Bitney College Preparatory High School students have been growing plants in a greenhouse for months this school year.
<br>
<br>The school’s gardening class has been gathering plants grown from seed for the school as it hosts a plant sale this week.
<br>
<br>The plants are for sale after school from 3:30 to 4 p.m. at 135 Joerschke Drive in Grass Valley.
<br>
<br>Students worked to grow many types of plants including but not limited to: beans, onion, squash, pumpkins, several assorted greens, a few fruits including tomatoes, and a few trees. Baked goods will also be offered from the Bitney Prep baking class.
<br>
<br>“We want to encourage everyone who wants a garden this summer to have one,” said Misha Rauchwerger, who runs the gardening program.
<br>
<br>All proceeds for the event will go toward helping to continue the program by funding next year’s gardening class for supplies like seeds, soil, and tools. Some proceeds will be directed toward a field trip to Sierra Harvest’s Food Love Project Farm.
<br>
